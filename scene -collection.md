What is a scene collection?

A scene collection (in context, this is commonly referred to as simply collection) is a collection of scenes. When a collection is opened, all its associated scenes will be opened, but not before all existing scenes are closed. Loading screens are also supported, out of the box.

Loading Screens

Loading screens are automatically opened when a collection is opened or closed.
